          <p>At re:learn, our goal is to help schools use technology in a smart way to enhance learning. 
                Through content curation and capacity development - with a wide network of trained facilitators, our aim is to improve the learning experience in and out of the classroom.
                 The re:learn Centre located in Abuja is a home of experimentation as we identify innovative ways to equip teachers and students with 21st century tools to accelerate the delivery of content and ultimately studentsâ€™ learning.
